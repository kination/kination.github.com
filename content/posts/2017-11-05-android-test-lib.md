This is the following post of [Create own module project - Android](android-make-lib), and shows the way to keep your module stable continuously.


### Make tests

Test is important to make your project reliable. As your project going bigger, there will be lots of bugs, and it is tough to keep your codes stable while fixing and modifing it.
It is pretty easy to setup your test for Android. Actually, it builds up when you create it as `ExampleInstrumentedTest` and `ExampleUnitTest`. Instrument test is for testing UI process flow, and it is being tested on virtual/real devices. Unit test is for testing internal data logic of classes or modules and it is running on JVM, so you cannot access Android APIs like `Context` or else. 

This is to just look on process of test, so I'll make a simple unit test.

Check gradle file and see module for test has been included(usually it has by default).
{% highlight shell %}
{% raw %}
dependencies {
    ...
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now write test code.
[ExampleUnitTest.java]
{% highlight java %}
{% raw %}
public class ExampleUnitTest {

    private static final String TARGET_TEST_STRING = "My name is John. Last name is Doe. Doe family is living here.";
    private Reducer reducer;

    @Before
    public void setupParam() {
        reducer = Reducer.getInstance();
    }

    @Test
    public void testSpaceDelimeter() throws Exception {
        String delimeter_space = " ";
        ArrayList<WordPair> parsedText = reducer.textToPair(TARGET_TEST_STRING, delimeter_space);
        assertEquals(parsedText.size(), 9);
        assertEquals(parsedText.get(1).word, "name");
        assertEquals(parsedText.get(1).number, 2);
    }

    @Test
    public void moreTest() throws Exception {
        // more test...
    }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is to test `textToPair` logic what we just tried now. 

In test code, there are several decorator being used to define test process. `@Before` is the function which will be running before starting test, and functions with `@Test` decorator will be running in actual test. If you need something to do after test, use `@After`. It once has been defined with fixed function name(runnning function with name `setUp` before test, and test functions which starts with name `test`), but it has been changed from `AndroidJUnit4`.

`assertEquals` is to compare results with expected value. It compares 2 parameter and return exception when it is not equal value. Code in `testSpaceDelimeter` checks whether size of list `parsedText` are 9, second value of list is "name", and number of second value is 2. Because it is all correct as we see in Activity code, test passes here. You can run test simply in Android Studio with `Run` button.

### Open, and manage your project

Before going on, I'll update this project to Github.

Now project is opened, and ready to go further.
We have module for word counting and test logic to check it is working correctly. You could improve current logic, fix bugs, or create new one. Maybe other committer who are interested in this project could do it. 
But during project being grown up, some of commits could break module's logic and make test fail. So it needs a logic to check status continuously, and `Travis` could help it.


### Continuous integration with Travis CI

![Screenshot](/assets/post_img/android_module_cli/travis-main.png)

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a continuous integration platform used to build and test software projects hosted in GitHub. Unless you are planning to make your repository private, you can use it for free. 

For activate travis, you need to add `.travis.yml` script in root directory of project. It  will include projects build definitions.
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
language: android
jdk: oraclejdk8

android:
  components:
      - platform-tools
      - tools
      - build-tools-25.0.0
      - android-25
      - extra-android-m2repository
      - extra-google-m2repository
      - extra-android-support

  licenses:
      - 'android-sdk-preview-license-.+'
      - 'android-sdk-license-.+'
      - 'google-gdk-license-.+'

script:
    - ./gradlew test
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is the setting I used.
It needs to define language and it is set as `Android`(though it is not a language, but it needs different logic with common `Java`). Below `android`, it defines components which needs for project build, and a license for android components. Version of 'build-tools' and 'android' below 'components' has to be same with the value defined in gradle script.

One thing you should know is, you need to define `Java` as 'oraclejdk8' to make it work. 'oraclejdk7' does not work anymore in travis, and Android does not support 'openjdk'. You could find detail about this [here](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7884).

And finally put in `script` to define command needs to be run on deployment.

If you added this file, find your repo in travis-ci and make it enable to run the script you made.

This makes your build script triggered with push event to this repository. I pushed simple README file, and travis will recognize it like this.

Now you are prepare to develop/manage your project.
