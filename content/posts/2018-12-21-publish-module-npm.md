One way to show your output as a developer, is releasing a module which offers specific function to help development. Most of modern programming language has its own package manager(Python-pip, Rust-cargo, Java-maven, ...), so it helps to release and introduce your stuff and make it simple to be used by engineers.

I once write a note about releasing project in [bower](https://bower.io/) package manager. But because of several problems, most of people suggest to go over to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and even bower project itself suggest to do as that way.

So this post will just focus with `npm`.


## How I started to do this
When I was developing front-end side(React + TypeScript), back-end side was developed in PHP and Python. Our team wanted to keep front-end side code to follow [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) rule, but parameters sent from back-end side was [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). It forced some of codes to follow snake case, so I thought of wrapping the response data, and convert parameter style directly.

Above this, I also added type converter logic. It supports to change integer value `0 or 1` to boolean, and date string to `Date` type. Because our project is based on TypeScript, this became quite useful.

This is the project [tucson](https://github.com/kination/tucson) I updated.


## So, it is useful?
This works are just focusing to reduce the code. It is small project, with 2~300 lines of code only, and no high-level mathematical logic. Somebody could think they can be do it by themself. But actually, more than half of the modules can be refused by same reason.

I really want to suggest that, don't become so serious for starting up. It will hesitate your work to create something, as I did. It is important to think the usefulness, but it does not need to be so great.

So if somebody ask about this 'Is it useful?', than I would say 'Not sure, but it could be to somebody.'


## Start from empty space
If you are JavaScript(or TypeScript) user, just start with `npm init` for now. This command will generate skeleton code for project.
```
$ npm init
...
...

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (your-package)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to /path/to/your-package/package.json:

{
  "name": "module-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

If you are TypeScript user, using `tsc` command will help quick setting.
```
$ tsc --init
message TS6071: Successfully created a tsconfig.json file.
```

Now you will have `tsconfig.json` file for typescript compile, and `package.json` file for node project configuration. Look on `tsconfig` first.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./lib",
    "strict": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/__tests__/*"]
}
```

This is configuration for compiling typescript files. TypeScript files for project will be included inside '/src' directory, so defined as `"include": ["src"]`. `compilerOptions/outDir` is the location which compiled result(JavaScript file) will be located. It's your decision, but I setup here to be go on inside '/lib'.

This compiled file is a build output, not coded result by developer. So it is better to exclude on your git repository.


## Make some function
Let's make very simple thing here. This is function reversing letters of words inside phrase.

[/src/index.ts]
```typescript
export function reverseWordsInPhrase(phrase: string): string {
  let wordList = phrase.split(/\b\s+/)
  let reversed = wordList.map((word) => {
    return reverseWord(word)
  })

  return reversed.join(' ')
}

function reverseWord(word: string): string {
  let newString = ''
  for (let a = word.length - 1; a >= 0; a--) {
    newString += word[a]
  }

  return newString
}
```
By using this, phrase `news in NBA trade deadline` becomes `swen ni ABN edart enildaed`. Do not care how meaningless this function is...it's just for test.

Command `tsc` will generate 'index.js' file in 'lib' directory. This is the actual function to be used for the user. 

After file is built, make a sample file for test this.

```javascript
let reverse = require('./lib/index.js').reverseWords

console.log(reverse('news in NBA trade deadline'))
```

If you could see the function working, you are ready to go on.


## Some good things to do before release - test & CI
I once updated post [testing and releasing module for Android](http://kination.github.io/android-test-lib), wrote about testing and CI(continous integration). I'll do the same thing for this. Working for `npm` package also has the same process. 

Let's make simple unit test with [mocha](https://mochajs.org/). We just check the result of function with example, so let's use that example for test.

Add new file in '/test' directory.

```javascript
let assert = require('assert');
let reverse = require('../lib/index.js').reverseWords

describe('first test', () => {
  let testString = ''
  before(() => {
    testString = 'news in NBA trade deadline'
  })

  describe('check reverse', () => {
    it('words in test string should be reversed', function() {
      assert.equal(reverse(testString), 'swen ni ABN edart enildaed')
    });
  });
});
```

Install `mocha`, and run test to check the module works well.
```
$ mocha

  first test
    check reverse
      âœ“ words in test string should be reversed

  1 passing (8ms)
```

Now setup CI process, by making `.travis.yml` file. But before that, let's register command for test in `package.json` file:
```json
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha",
    "build": "tsc",
  },
  ...
```

than add command to travis config file. It's way more simple than Android:
```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 'stable'
before_script:
  - npm install
script:
  - npm run build
  - npm run test
```

Now test will be triggered by commitment(this can be changed by setting), so you could check your commit breaks the module or not.


## Pre-setup
Now prepare to release your package to npm repository, to make people can use it. You should connect to your npm account, so login with:
```
$ npm login
```
and setup with your username and password.

Than check `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "module-name",
  "version": "module-version",
  "description": "module-description",
  "main": "lib/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha",
    "build": "tsc",
    "prepublishOnly": "yarn run build && yarn run test"
  },
  "author": "your-name-or-email",
  "repository": "your-repository",
  // ...
}
```

`scripts/prepublishOnly` is the command triggered by `npm publish` command, which makes your local package published to `npm` repository. So put on build(and test) process here to make your compiled file updated.

One more, `npm publish` will update all files in your project. But actually, some of files are useless for your module, such as files in '/test' or examples you made. Add `.npmignore` file and add a list of files which will be not be published.


## ...and release
This is the log of `npm publish` from module [tucson](https://github.com/kination/tucson) I introduced here.

```
$ npm publish

> tucson@0.2.1 prepublishOnly .
> yarn run test && yarn run build

yarn run v1.7.0
$ mocha


  to camelcase
    check key
      âœ“ key should be changed as camelcase
    check makeDate
      âœ“ value with `makeDate` should be converted as Moment
