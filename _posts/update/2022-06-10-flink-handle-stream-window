Data stream is a flow of data, which are coming from multiple sources continuously. It can be event log or database log captured by CDC internally, or sensor data from IoT devices.

These kind of streams are usually very high-frequent in production level, and in this case we will think of connecting sources into stream processing framework to handle it, such as Spark or Flink.

Because I've started using Flink recently, so try to look on how this is being treated.
